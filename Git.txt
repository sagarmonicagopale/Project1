Print Working Directory:
- pwd

How to add current folder in repository:
- git init
- git add
- git commit


ls => To show folder list
ls -la => Shows all hidden files
git add . => To add all files... Here dot means it add all files
git add firstFile.txt  => It will add only firstFile.txt file

Working directory > Staging area > repository
Working directory = When we create file. It store only in local directory/working directory
Staging are = When you add file by using git command. It will add in staging area. And if it is in staging area it mean it is not keeping version of this file.
Repository = When you commit file. It will go in repository. Git will keep track of it.

git commit -m "This is first commit"   => Commit the changes, Here -m is for adding msg
git log  => Shows history of commit
git log --authod="sagar"  => Shows log of Sagar user, Here we can type author name as sub string of author name no need exat name
clear  => To clear the console
git status  => Gives us the status of local repository.. Ex. 1. New file added, If edited existing file.. etc

Note: If we edit a file again we need to add it to staging area and than commit it.

We can commit all files in repository directly without need of adding in staging. Check below command:
- git commit -am "msg"  => Avoid to use this command.

- git diff  => Shows diffrence of local and repository

IMP: When we add edited file in staging area and if we try to find the diffrence between working copy n repository it will show no diffrences.
Please use below command for above case:
- git diff --staged   => It shows diffrence between staging files and repository files

- git rm third.txt  => To delete file from working copy and repository as well, Need to commit after delete

-----------------------------------
Renaming files:
1. (Difficult way)
- Rename file name in working copy(oldFileName to NewFileName)
- git add newFileName.txt
- git rm oldFileName.txt
- git status
- git commit

2. (Easy way)
- git mv oldFileName.txt newFileName.txt
Here, mv means move... In git moving a file is same as renaming file.


Moving files into another folder
- git mv filename.txt folderName/
- git mv filename.txt folderName/newFilaName.txt   (Move and renaming file)
------------------------------------
- git checkout -- filename.txt  => To copy repository file into working directory

Removing file from staging area and sending back to working area:
- git reset HEAD first.html

How to get old version of file from repository:
- git log  => See log ang copy revision id or unique id of commit/revision
- git checkout revison_id_of_commit -- first.html
- git status
- git commit

GITHUB
------------------------------------------------------------------


Push a project to github
- First create new repository (tutorials) on github.com (It will give you url of this repository)

YOU CAN ADD NICKNAME FOR githubUrlOfRepository
- git remote add githubRepo https://github.com/sagargopale/tutorials.git
- git remote

- git push -u githubUrlOfRepository master  => It will ask your un/pw of gitub

Q. How to commit specific files?



-------------------------------------------------
Adding new project to git repository first time
- git init
- git remote add origin https://github.com/sagarmonicagopale/Project1.git
- git push -u origin master
-------------------------------------------------
- git branch proj1Branch1  // create new branch 'proj1Branch1' on local machine... this brach is copy of current directory path(master)
- git branch  // Show list of local branch
- git fetch  // Show list of remote branch
- git checkout proj1Branch1  // Change branch from master to proj1Branch1
- git push --set-upstream origin proj1Branch1  // Push proj1Branch1 code to GitHub proj1Branch1 branch and create proj1Branch1 branch on github
---------------------------------
add new file 'file4.txt' in local proj1Branch1 branch and commit it.
If u want to push it to github remote repository
- git push   //Hit this command from local proj1Branch1 branch... or Push local changes to remote repository
OR We can use below command:
- git push origin proj1Branch1
---------------------------------
If u want to take latest code of master branch
- git pull origin master  // Hit this command from proj1Branch1 branch	
-----------------------------------
If u have updated code from master repository then we need to add updated code into our github remote branch....
- git push		// Hit this command from proj1Branch1 branch... Push local 
-----------------------------------
